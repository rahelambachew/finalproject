                <center><p> Studentivity was created as the final project for the Girls Who Code summer immersion program. It is designed to help students stay productive and organized.

                <center><h3>About The Makers:</h3></center>
                <center><p> We are Mikaelyn, Rahel, Jelani, and Selome, and we participated in the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program. For our final project, we 
                wanted to create something that will motivate students to complete their work on time and not procrastinate. Procrastination is a problem that everyone, 
                including us, dela with during the school year. We believe studentivity will work to curb those procrastination tendencies.</p></center>
